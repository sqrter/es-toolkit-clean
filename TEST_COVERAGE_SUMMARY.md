# Test Coverage Summary - es-toolkit-clean

## Overview
We have **93 comprehensive tests**, achieving **96.29% overall code coverage**.

## Coverage Results
- **Overall Coverage**: 96.29% statements, 98.57% branches, 93.75% functions
- **Core Files**: 100% coverage across all core functionality
- **Validators**: 100% coverage for all type checking and empty value validators
- **Transformers**: 100% coverage for all transformation utilities
- **Helpers**: 100% coverage

## Test Files

### 1. `test/validators.test.ts` (16 tests)
- Type checking validators (isArray, isBoolean, isDate, isFunction, etc.)
- Empty value validators (isEmptyString, isEmptyObject, isEmptyArr, isEmptyArray)
- Array filtering utilities (rejectEmpty)

### 2. `test/clean.test.ts` (20 tests)
- Core cleaning functions (cleanString, cleanArray, cleanObject)
- Transformer utilities (rmEmpty, rmTrue, reducer)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### 3. `test/edge-cases.test.ts` (23 tests)
- Large and deeply nested structures performance testing
- Special JavaScript values (Symbol, BigInt, RegExp, Error, Map, Set)
- Processor configuration edge cases
- Type coercion scenarios
- Default processor behavior verification

### 4. `test/helpers.test.ts` (24 tests)
- **Helper functions testing**
- Transform function coverage via cleanObject integration
- Helper function edge cases (rmEmpty, rmTrue, reducer)
- String and array cleaning comprehensive scenarios
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Array-like object handling and inherited properties
- Deep nesting and special value handling
- Direct transform function behavior testing
- Reducer edge cases and error scenarios

### 5. `test/index.test.ts` (7 tests)
- Main API functionality
- Integration tests

### 6. `test/processor.test.ts` (3 tests)
- Processor creation and configuration
- Custom processor behavior

## Key Testing Insights Discovered

### 1. es-toolkit `isEmpty` Behavior
- Numbers, booleans, null, and undefined are considered "empty"
- This affects how `rmEmpty` and `cleanString` behave with non-string values

### 2. Symbol Property Handling
- Symbol properties are not included in `Object.entries()` iteration
- Objects with only Symbol keys become empty after cleaning

### 3. Function Removal
- Functions are removed by default during cleaning
- Objects with toString/valueOf functions have these methods stripped

### 4. Nested Structure Limitations
- `isEmptyArray` only performs one level of recursion
- Deeply nested empty structures are not fully detected

## Areas with Partial Coverage

### Non-functional Files
- `commitlint.config.js` (configuration file, 0% coverage expected)
- `src/types/common.ts` (type definitions only, 0% coverage expected)

## Test Quality Improvements

1. **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Tests now cover circular references, large datasets, and performance scenarios
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing in tests with appropriate type assertions
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests reflect actual usage patterns and expected behaviors
4. **Error Handling**: Tests verify graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs
5. **Performance Testing**: Basic performance tests ensure the library scales reasonably

## Recent Improvements

### Migration to es-toolkit Transform Function
- **Removed custom transform function**: Eliminated 23 lines of custom code
- **Improved coverage**: helpers.ts now has 100% coverage (up from 78.57%)
- **Enhanced reliability**: Using well-tested es-toolkit implementation
- **Consolidated test files**: Merged `transform-coverage.test.ts` and `transform-direct.test.ts` into `helpers.test.ts`
- **Streamlined test organization**: Reduced from 102 to 93 tests while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- **Fixed edge cases**: Better handling of non-object accumulators and empty object scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Performance benchmarks** could be expanded for very large datasets
2. **Integration tests** with real-world data structures could be valuable
3. **Error boundary tests** for malformed inputs could be added
4. **Consider adding tests** for complex circular reference scenarios

## Conclusion

The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of the es-toolkit-clean library, ensuring reliability and maintainability. The tests cover not just the happy path, but also edge cases, performance scenarios, and integration points, making this a robust foundation for the library.
